# Recent items for Shoreditch

As [Shoreditch](https://civicrm.org/extensions/shoreditch) is best used with a theme without sidebars, the "Recently
viewed" block is not really useful anymore. This extension adds those links
in a sub menu within CiviCRM's navigation menu.

Since the navigation menu is cached, the "Recent items" sub menu is being
rebuilt for every page load and put into place via Ajax. This has the advantage
that every CiviCRM entity being viewed or edited within a popup is immediately
available within the "Recent items" sub menu.

## Installation
Simply install the extension. Works best with the Shoreditch extension.
